            <p class="text-body"></p>
            The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students
            with intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in the
            practice of an array of visual arts media within the context
            of a liberal arts university. As a part of the first
            institution of higher learning to successfully integrate a
            studio-based education into such a broad pedagogical
            framework, the Yale School of Art has a long and distinguished
            history of training artists of the highest caliber. A
            full-time faculty of working artists in conjunction with a
            diverse cross-section of accomplished visiting artists
            collaborate to design a program and foster an environment
            where the unique talents and perspectives of individual
            students can emerge and flourish. <br>

            <p>
            The School of Art is founded on the belief that art is a
            fundamental force in national and international culture, and
            that one of the primary standards by which societies are
            judged is the quality, creative freedom, critical insight, and
            formal and technical innovation of the visual art they
            produce. The Yale School of Art teaches at the graduate and
            undergraduate levels, and consequently the student body
            consists of those whose primary or exclusive focus is art as
            well as those for whom art is an essential part of a varied
            course of inquiry. The school currently offers degrees and
            undergraduate majors in the areas of graphic design,
            painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture.
